Now, there are 5 different AI assistants - A1, B2, C3, D4 and E5.

Rice isn't planted in the North or the South.\\n2. The crop that needs Moderate temperature is grown in the East.\\n3. Barley doesn't need High humidity to grow.\\n4. Wheat can't tolerate strong winds.\\n5. Maize is not grown in the West.\\n6. The crop with Low sunlight requires neither Barley nor Rice.\\n\\nQuestion: Can you identify which crop is planted in each region and its weather condition?\\n\\n\\nLet's start by identifying which crop needs a specific weather condition according to clues 1, 2, 3 and 4 - High humidity: None; Moderate temperature: Maize; Low Sunlight: Barley; Strong winds: Wheat.\\n\\nFrom step1, we know that Rice cannot be grown in North or South (clue 1) and it also can't be grown in the West because the crop requiring Low sunlight cannot grow in the West (clue 6). Hence, Rice must be grown in East with Moderate temperature, so by clue 2, we know that Maize is planted in the East.\\n\\nNow let's consider Wheat - It can't tolerate strong winds (clue 4) and since all other regions are taken except North, the only region left for Wheat to grow is West.\\n\\nFollowing step 3, from clue 6, we learn that Barley needs Low sunlight which isn’t suitable for North and South as well because Rice already occupies those locations in East and Wheat in West. Therefore, the only place Barley can be grown is in the South. \\n\\nFinally, for the remaining region - North, the crop requiring High humidity has to be planted there. The only crop left is Maize which can grow with high humidity as it's the last condition that doesn't require any other crops to fulfill its requirement.\\n\\nAnswer: \\nNorth- Barley (Low Sunlight)\\nSouth- Rice (Moderate Temperature)\\nEast - Maize (High Humidity)\\nWest - Wheat (Strong Winds)\\n</td>\n",

They are not legally binding but aim to create an egalitarian society with equal opportunities for all.\\n\\n\\nConsider five different regions of India, each known for producing a specific type of traditional Indian food: North (Saffron Rice), West (Butter Chicken), South (Chutneys), East (Dosa) and Central (Gravy). Now, there are 5 different AI assistants - A1, B2, C3, D4 and E5. Each assistant is known for its efficiency in giving the correct answers. \\n\\nIt's been found that an Indian child always eats food from the region associated with the region of origin of the first letter of his name. For example, if a child's name starts with 'N', he would eat Saffron Rice (North). \\n\\nWe know:\\n1. B2 is efficient in answering about Saffron Rice but doesn't live in North.\\n2. D4 lives in South and is not efficient at giving answers related to Butter Chicken (West) and Gravy (Central).\\n3. E5 cannot provide information regarding Dosa (East), Chutneys (South) or Saffron Rice (North).\\n\\nQuestion: Given this, which AI assistant would be most suitable for a child named \"Nitin\" who doesn't like the food from South?\\n\\n\\nFirst, we need to find a region that Nitin is unfamiliar with. Since he does not live in North and cannot be associated with Saffron Rice (North), his familiar regions are: West - Butter Chicken, East - Dosa, Central - Gravy. \\n\\nNitin also dislikes the food from South. So, the only AI assistant that isn't efficient at giving an answer for a region known to produce food not liked by Nitin is E5. Therefore, it's safe to assume that if he wants correct information about food that isn't produced in South, Nitin should use AI Assistant A1 (Saffron Rice) or B2 (Butter Chicken).\\n\\nAnswer: Nitin could either use AI Assistant A1 or B2 for the child's questions.\\n   \n",

Rice isn't planted in the North or the South.\\n2. The crop that needs Moderate temperature is grown in the East.\\n3. Barley doesn't need High humidity to grow.\\n4. Wheat can't tolerate strong winds.\\n5. Maize is not grown in the West.\\n6. The crop with Low sunlight requires neither Barley nor Rice.\\n\\nQuestion: Can you identify which crop is planted in each region and its weather condition?\\n\\n\\nLet's start by identifying which crop needs a specific weather condition according to clues 1, 2, 3 and 4 - High humidity: None; Moderate temperature: Maize; Low Sunlight: Barley; Strong winds: Wheat.\\n\\nFrom step1, we know that Rice cannot be grown in North or South (clue 1) and it also can't be grown in the West because the crop requiring Low sunlight cannot grow in the West (clue 6). Hence, Rice must be grown in East with Moderate temperature, so by clue 2, we know that Maize is planted in the East.\\n\\nNow let's consider Wheat - It can't tolerate strong winds (clue 4) and since all other regions are taken except North, the only region left for Wheat to grow is West.\\n\\nFollowing step 3, from clue 6, we learn that Barley needs Low sunlight which isn’t suitable for North and South as well because Rice already occupies those locations in East and Wheat in West. Therefore, the only place Barley can be grown is in the South. \\n\\nFinally, for the remaining region - North, the crop requiring High humidity has to be planted there. The only crop left is Maize which can grow with high humidity as it's the last condition that doesn't require any other crops to fulfill its requirement.\\n\\nAnswer: \\nNorth- Barley (Low Sunlight)\\nSouth- Rice (Moderate Temperature)\\nEast - Maize (High Humidity)\\nWest - Wheat (Strong Winds)\\n   \n",

It has the power to interpret the Constitution, review the laws made by the Parliament and the state legislatures, settle disputes between different organs of the government, and issue writs for the protection of the citizens' rights. It also plays a role in appointing and transferring judges, and resolving conflicts among high courts.\\n   \n",
